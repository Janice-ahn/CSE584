    "Question": "What gravitational forces between the Earth, Moon, and Sun cause tides, and what distinguishes spring tides from neap tides? A. Gravitational pull of the Earth and the Moon; Spring tides have lower highs and higher lows, occurring during the first and third quarters of the moon B. Gravitational pull of the Sun and the Earth; Spring tides have lower highs and higher lows, occurring during full and new moons C. Gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun; Spring tides have lower highs and higher lows, occurring during the first and third quarters of the moon",

    "problem Id": 32,
    "response": [
        "The correct answer is A. Gravitational pull of the Earth and the Moon; Spring tides have lower highs and higher lows, occurring during the first and third quarters of the moon. \nTides are caused by the gravitational forces between the Earth, Moon, and Sun. The gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's oceans causes two high and two low tides each day. However, the gravitational forces between the Earth and the Moon have a stronger effect on the tides than the gravitational forces between the Earth and the Sun. \nSpring tides occur when the gravitational forces of the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned, resulting in a stronger gravitational pull on the Earth's oceans. This causes the two high tides to be closer together and the two low tides to be farther apart, resulting in lower highs and higher lows. Spring tides occur during the first and third quarters of the Moon, when the Moon is at a right angle to the Earth and Sun.</s>"
