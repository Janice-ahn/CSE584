        "The correct answer is E. 18 from a sperm cell, 18 from an egg.\n\nIn cats, meiosis occurs in the reproductive cells (gametes), resulting in the reduction of the diploid number of chromosomes (38) to the haploid number (19) in each gamete. This means that each gamete contains 19 chromosomes.\n\nWhen a sperm cell (with 19 chromosomes) fertilizes an egg cell (also with 19 chromosomes), the resulting zygote inherits 19 chromosomes from the sperm and 19 chromosomes from the egg. Therefore, the total number of chromosomes in the zygote is 38, which is the diploid number.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The zygote does not inherit all 36 chromosomes from each gamete. Instead, each gamete contributes 19 chromosomes.\n\nB. The egg cell does not contribute all 36 chromosomes. It contributes 19 chromosomes, which is the haploid number.\n\nC. The mitotic division of a gamete would not result in the combination of chromosomes from two different parents. Mitosis is the process of cell division that occurs in somatic cells, not gametes.\n\nD. The sperm cell does not contribute all 36 chromosomes. It contributes 19"

The heat energy of the water can be calculated as:\n\nQ1 = mc\u0394T = (10.0 g) \u00d7 (4.18 J/g\u00b0C) \u00d7 (159.00\u00b0C - 100.00\u00b0C) = 6824 J\n\nwhere m is the mass of the water, c is the specific heat capacity of water, and \u0394T is the temperature change.\n\n2. The 3.00 g of gold at 15.20\u00b0C is then added to the calorimeter.

    "response": [
        "The correct answer is C. Gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun; Spring tides have higher highs and higher lows, occurring during new moon and full moon.\n\nTides are caused by the gravitational forces between the Earth, Moon, and Sun. The Moon's gravity causes the oceans to bulge out on the side of the Earth facing the Moon and in on the opposite side. This creates two high tides and two low tides each day, as the Earth rotates relative to the Moon's position.\n\nThe Sun also has a gravitational effect on the oceans, although it is much weaker than the Moon's. However, when the Sun and Moon are aligned (at new moon or full moon), their gravitational forces work together to create even higher high tides and lower low tides, known as spring tides. This is because the Sun's gravitational force is pulling on the same side of the Earth as the Moon's, amplifying the effect.\n\nWhen the Sun and Moon are at right angles to each other (at quarter moon), their gravitational forces cancel each other out, resulting in lower high tides and higher low tides, known as neap tides.\n\nSo, option C is the correct answer.
