This ball is thrown upwards, so its initial velocity v_1 will be negative. Assuming that upwards is in the positive direction, acceleration due to gravity is -g = -9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nFor the first ball, the total displacement until it reaches its peak height and falls back to the starting point is 0, and so its equation of motion becomes:\n\n0 = v_1*t - 1/2* g* t\u00b2.\n\nNow let's consider the second ball. This one is dropped, so it starts at rest (v_2 = 0) and falls under gravity. By the time the first ball returns to its starting position, the second ball has fallen by a distance of 12 m, so its equation of motion is:\n\n-12 = 0*t - 1/2* g* t\u00b2.\n\nSolving for 't' in the second equation, we get t = sqrt(2*12/g) \u2248 1.56 seconds.\n\nWe can substitute this time back into the first equation to give:\n\n0 = v_1*1.56 - 1/2* g* (1.56)\u00b2,\n\nSolving for v_1, we get the speed of the first ball as v_1 = 0.5* g* (1.56) \u2248 7.68 m/s. \n\nTherefore, the maximum speed at which the first ball can be thrown so that it does not collide with the second ball is about 7.68 m/s."

Thus, the second equation must be true:\n\n    2\u03b8\u2081 + 2\u03b8\u2082 = \u03c0\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n    \u03b8\u2081 + \u03b8\u2082 = \u03c0/2\n\nwhich tells us that the two angles must sum to 90\u00b0.\n\nThis result makes intuitive sense. The maximum horizontal distance for a projectile (without air resistance) is achieved when it is launched at an angle of 45\u00b0. If one cannonball takes twice as long to reach this maximum distance, it must be because it is launched at an angle greater than 45\u00b0; whereas the other cannonball is launched at an angle less than 45\u00b0. These two angles must add up to 90\u00b0 to achieve the same horizontal distance."

        "The problem involves a swimmer trying to cross a river of width 10 m while fighting the current. The swimmer could swim 100 m in still water, but the current of the river will drive him downstream.\n\nLet's consider the problem step by step:\n\n(a) The minimum distance that you must start upstream of the waterfall.\n\nSince the swimmer could swim 100 m in still water and the width of the river is 10 m, he could theoretically cross the river 10 times before his muscles shut down. However, because of the current, every attempt of crossing the river will get him further downstream.\n\nTherefore, during one straight crossing (i.e., perpendicular to the stream), the swimmer will drift 10 m downstream (since the swimmer's speed is equal to the stream's speed). Hence, to stay safe, the swimmer should start from a minimum distance that is 10 times the downstream drift during one crossing, which is 10 m * 10 = 100 m upstream of the waterfall.\n\n(b) The direction in which the swimmer must swim to get across. \n\nSince the swimmer can swim straight across (perpendicularly) to the other bank, but needs to account for the unexpected downstream drift due to the current, he has to aim his swimming route slightly upstream. Specially, the swimmer needs to swim directly across the stream, aiming at a point upstream which would account for the downstream shift that the current will cause. The exact angle or direction would be hard to calculate without more precise data, but in practical terms, he should aim sufficiently upstream to offset the 10 m downstream drift due to the river's current. This could be visualized as a \"slanted\" direction to the North-East (assuming that the north is opposite to the stream current)."

        "We need to use the formula for heat transfer: Q = mc\u0394T where m is mass, c is specific heat and \u0394T is the change in temperature. \n\nWe set up the equation that total heat gained equals total heat lost. This is based on the principle of conservation of energy which says that energy cannot be created or lost, only transformed:\n\nHeat lost by water = Heat gained by the gold\n\nmc\u0394T (for water) = mc\u0394T (for gold)\n\nMass of water is 10.0 g, initial temperature of water is 159.0\u00b0C, and specific heat of water is 4.18 J/g\u00b0C.\n\nMass of gold is 3.0 g, initial temperature of gold is 15.2\u00b0C, and specific heat of gold is 0.128 J/g\u00b0C.\n\nLet's denote the final temperature as T. Then, the changes in temperatures are (T-159.0) for water and (T-15.2) for gold. Remember that the gold will increase in temperature (it is absorbing heat from the hot water), so its temperature change should be positive. But the water will lose heat, so its temperature change will be negative.\n\nSo, we have the heat exchange equation:\n\n10.0g * 4.18 J/g\u00b0C * (T - 159\u00b0C) = 3.00g * 0.128 J/g\u00b0C * (T - 15.2\u00b0C)\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for T:\n\n4.18T - 664.2 = 0.384T - 5.80\n\nSolving for T gives:\n\nT = (664.2 + 5.80) / (4.18 - 0.384)\n\nT = 155\u00b0C\n\nTherefore, the final temperature of the water in the calorimeter is 155\u00b0C."

        "(b) add NO\n\nBased on Le Chatelier's principle, if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to counteract the change. So if you add more NO, the reaction will adjust by moving the equilibrium to the right to consume some of these NO molecules, thereby producing more NO2."

    "Question": "When 10.0 g KOH is dissolved in 100.0 g of water in a coffee-cup calorimeter, the temperature rises from 47.53 'C to 25.18 'C. What is the enthalpy change per gram of KOH dissolved in the water? Assume that the solution has a specific heat capacity of 4.18 J/g0C.",
    "Discipline": "Chemistry",
    "problem Id": 24,
    "response": [
        "The fact that the temperature rose indicates that the dissolving KOH reaction is exothermic and hence, the enthalpy change, \u0394H, should be negative. The heat gained by the solution can be calculated by using the equation: \nq = mc\u0394T\nwhere \nq is heat,\nm is mass, \nc is specific heat capacity, \nand \u0394T is the temperature change. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the heat gained, q:\n\nThe mass of the solution, m, is the sum of the masses of KOH and water, which is 10 g + 100 g = 110 g.\n\nThe specific heat capacity, c, is 4.18 J/g\u00b0C.\n\nThe change in temperature, \u0394T, is the final temperature minus the initial temperature, which is 47.53 \u00b0C - 25.18 \u00b0C = 22.35 \u00b0C.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation gives: \n\nq = (110 g)(4.18 J/g\u00b0C)(22.35 \u00b0C) = 10279.59 J  \n\nNow, as the reaction is exothermic (the temperature rose), we must put a negative sign on our answer to indicate that the reaction releases heat. \n\nq = -10279.59 J. \n\nFinally, we calculate the enthalpy change per gram of KOH by dividing by the mass of KOH:\n\n\u0394H = q/m(KOH) = -10279.59 J / 10 g = -1027.96 J/g.\n\nSo, the enthalpy change per gram of KOH dissolved in the water is -1027.96 J/g."
