Therefore, the component of the swimmer's path that is parallel to the riverbank (perpendicular to the direction of the current) is 100m / 10 = 10m.\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance that the swimmer must start upstream in order to not be swept over it is 10m.\n\nIn terms of direction, if the swimmer starts 10m upstream from the desired landing point and aims directly for the landing point, they will be swimming at an angle of 0 degrees relative to the west, or directly east.\n\nThat's assuming that all distances are precise, the river is uniform in speed and width, and that the swimmer swims at a constant speed. Real world conditions might affect this. \n\nIf the swimmer's maximum swim distance in the cold water (-100m) is not a typo, then this situation is physically impossible. The negative distance implies that the swimmer's endurance in the cold water is effectively zero, so they cannot safely swim across the river at all."

        "First, there seems to be an error in the problem. Usually, the temperature of the solution should increase when a substance is dissolved, indicating that the process is exothermic (releasing heat). You've mentioned the temperature decreasing from 47.53 \u00b0C to 25.18 \u00b0C, which would suggest an endothermic process (absorbing heat). For the purposes of this explanation, let's assume the temperature increases from 25.18 \u00b0C to 47.53 \u00b0C.\n\nTo compute the heat change (q), we can use the formula:\n\nq = m * c * \u0394T\n\nwhere:\n- m is the total mass of the water + KOH = 100.0 g + 10.0 g = 110.0 g\n- c is the specific heat capacity = 4.18 J/g\u00b0C\n- \u0394T is the change in temperature = final temperature - initial temperature = 47.53\u00b0C - 25.18\u00b0C = 22.35\u00b0C\n\nSo,\n\nq = (110.0 g) * (4.18 J/g\u00b0C) * (22.35\u00b0C) = 10255.61 J\n\nThe result is positive, indicating that heat is released (exothermic process).\n\nThe enthalpy change per gram of KOH would then be calculated by dividing the total heat released by the mass of KOH:\n\nenthalpy change = - q / mass of KOH\n\n= -10255.61 J / 10.0 g\n\n= -1025.6 J/g \n\nThe negative sign indicates that the heat is being released.\n\nSo, the enthalpy change per gram of KOH is -1025.6 J/g."

    "Question": "What gravitational forces between the Earth, Moon, and Sun cause tides, and what distinguishes spring tides from neap tides? A. Gravitational pull of the Earth and the Moon; Spring tides have lower highs and higher lows, occurring during the first and third quarters of the moon B. Gravitational pull of the Sun and the Earth; Spring tides have lower highs and higher lows, occurring during full and new moons C. Gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun; Spring tides have lower highs and higher lows, occurring during the first and third quarters of the moon",
    "Discipline": "Astronomy",
    "problem Id": 32,
    "response": [
        "The correct answer is B. Gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon influences the tides on Earth, with the Moon having a stronger effect due to its relative proximity to Earth. Spring tides, characterized by higher highs and lower lows, occur during full and new moons when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned and their gravitational forces are combined. This is contrasted with the neap tides, with lower highs and higher lows, which occur during the first and third quarters of the moon when the Sun and Moon are at right angles to each other relative to the Earth, minimizing the effect of their combined gravitational pull and causing less pronounced tides."
